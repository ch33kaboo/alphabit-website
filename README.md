## ðŸš¨ Forking this repo (please read!)

Many students in ESI asked me if they can use this code for whatever website
they are working on, and the answer to that question is **yes, with
attribution**.

I value keeping this site open source, but as you all know, _**plagiarism is
bad**_. So please give me credit. I spent a non-trivial amount of effort
building this website, and I am proud of it! All I ask of you all is to not
claim this effort as your own.

### TL;DR

Yes, you can fork this repo. Please give me proper credit by linking back to
[github.com/ch33kaboo](https://github.com/ch33kaboo). Thanks!
